
Steps to run-
	1. Run *inference.py* file along with an argument which specifies the name of the model. Note that in order to run this file,
		all the features should be there in the features folder. All these features will be uploaded on learn dropbox.
		To run this file, execute the following command along with the model name. There can be four different parameters for this 
		command, namely, *neural,xgboost, gradient or randomforest *
							
						Eg:	**python inference.py neural**
			

	2. The other codes require all the features to be generated before running them. They do not require any additional arguments for running
		and all the files in the features are required to run them.
